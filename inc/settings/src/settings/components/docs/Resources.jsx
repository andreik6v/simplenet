			<p>Once you activate henry, it will largely behave like any other traditional WordPress theme. You can create posts and pages just like you always have. However, as a block theme, henry also supports powerful new features like the site editor, patterns, global styles, and more.</p>

			<p>A block theme is a WordPress theme with templates entirely composed of blocks so that in addition to post and page content, the block editor can also be used to edit all areas of the site â€” headers, footers, templates, and more.</p>

			<p>The henry theme works out of the box, so no build steps are required. However, I have included a Composer file that is used for linting to PHP and WordPress core standards.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>composer run lint</li>
				<li>composer run wpcs:scan</li>
				<li>composer run wpcs:fix</li>
			</ul>
